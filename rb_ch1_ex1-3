Exercise-1: 
1 - In computer jargon, whatâ€™s the difference between a statement and a comment?
  A comment is meant for just the programmer, and has no impact on the code itself. It is meant to explain and go into further detail on
  what the content written is actually meant and intended for. It is defined with the double slash "//" in Java. A statement is an actual
  part of the program itself, expressing an action to be carried out. For example, the very simple: System.out.println("Hello, World");

2- What does it mean to say that a program is portable?
  A program is portable if it can be picked up and put onto another set of hardware and still work. High-level programming languages such
  as Java allow this, whereas low-level programming languages are set to work on their hardware or architecture.

3 - In common English, what does the word compile mean?
  Putting the content of your code into a smaller and more simpler form and have the action be completed.

4 - What is an executable? Why is that word used as a noun?
  Executable means the action can be executed by a computer. It can be used as either an adjective or a noun. It can be used to describe
  the application, "an executable application." It can also be used as a noun. "Run the executable," as short for executable application.
  It is the the type of applciation that runs it, defined in windows as "{insert name here}.exe"
  
Exercise-2
1 - 
package pck;
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }
}
2 - 
package pck;
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
        System.out.println("yoyo how we doin world");
    }
}
3-
package pck;
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
      //my edition to the code is below this line
        System.out.println("yoyo how we doin world");
    }
}
